# calculator
This is a calculator project which uses html, css, javascript, and bootstrap. I tested it on Google Chrome but it should work on any browser that
can open html files and run javascript code.

Functionality is straightforward, press the buttons on the numberpad and it will post that on the top. Pressing the equals
sign resultingly gives you the answer.

There's only the 4 basic operations because this is my first html/css/javascript project but I would like to add more like
exponents, roots, etc.

If decimals are relevant to the equation, namely the answer of the equation, then the rounding goes to 5 decimal places. For
example if you punch in 1/3 that equals 0.33333. The answers will also round up, so for example 2/3 would equal 0.66667.

Aside from that, the "neg" button is to make numbers negative. To apply it to the first number you can either press neg before
entering the number, or after entering the number but before entering the operation. For example, neg -> 1 and 1 -> neg are the
same thing, they both give you -1. 

If you'd like the second number to be negative, you can either press the neg after the operation button but before entering the
number or after entering the number altogether.

The last button is the all clear or "AC" button which just clears the top result row. So pressing it erases the html and
resets the result row to 0, but also resets all the data for the previous first and second number as well as the operator if 
you had punched those in.

The colors are Warriors colors!
